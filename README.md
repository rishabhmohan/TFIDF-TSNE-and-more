# TFIDF-TSNE-and-more


## Data pre -processing: 
cleaning, tokeization, lemmatization


## Vectorizer
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequencies (tf-Idf) is advance version of Bag-of-Words model that uses the term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency


## Visualization
TSNE for visualization on PCA model: T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a tool to visualize high-dimensional data. 
It converts similarities between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of the low-dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data.

t-SNE has a cost function that is not convex, i.e. with different initializations we can get different results.

# Text classification 
Classfication done on TFIDF vectors using random forest classifier
